We are reading through the localization files of a visual novel to create a user-friendly xlsx database for our custom translation work.
Write a script to do the following:

Function 1: Parse text files in original folder to translate.xlsx, for each file:
- Line starting with ";" is a comment line
- Going through lines, the first non-comment line starting with # means it's file type 1, where:
  + Value after "# " is the ID of the dialog
  + Comment line(s) below that line is the <Original value>
  + Non-comment line(s) below is the <Localized value>
- Going through lines, the first non-comment line starting with an alphanumeric character means it's file type 2, where:
  + That line has the structure <ID>: <Localized value>
  + The line above, if is a comment line, is the <Original value>

We want to parse both file types, each file to its own sheet in the spreadsheet, to contain 4 columns:
ID: parsed from the data above
Original value: parsed from the data above
Translated value: parsed from the data above. Remember to trim blank lines
My translated value: this is a blank column

The first line should be decorated like a header line, and frozen.

Additionally, we want a Metadata sheet to contain these columns for the next function:
Sheet name
Mapped file name
File type

If translate.xlsx already exists, skip this function, and log that it already exists.


Function 2: Construct the "translated" folder with the data from translate.xlsx to have the output files with the same structure as "original"
Construct by going from the Metadata sheet.
For all file types:
For each ID, we want a new comment with the structure:
<Original value> comment
"; **Localized**"
<Localized value> comment
