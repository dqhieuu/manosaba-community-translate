Project: Localization of the Magical Girl Visual Novel
Goal: Create a complete, engaging, and faithful Vietnamese translation that preserves the tone, context, and character personalities of the original work.
Translation Guidelines

Content Preparation:
Remove all tags (including ruby tags and <br> tags) and concatenate them seamlessly before starting translation.
Completely eliminate lines starting with ">" (e.g., "> Ema: |#0101Adv02_Ema001|", "> Unknown: |#0101Adv02_Unknown001|").
Retain only the main content (Japanese dialogue or descriptions, including <br> for line breaks).
"Example input:
""> Ema: |#0101Adv02_Ema001|
何を考えていますの！？<br>わたくしをこんなところに閉じ込めるなんて！""
After cleaning: 何を考えていますの！？<br>わたくしをこんなところに閉じ込めるなんて！"

Comparison of Original and Intermediate Translation:
Compare the Chinese translation (Translated Value) with the original Japanese (Original Value) to ensure consistency in meaning and context.
The final Vietnamese translation must not contain any XML tags. Punctuation must use Vietnamese conventions (e.g., ".", ","), except for retaining "――".
The final Vietnamese translation (My translated value) must not contain any Chinese or Japanese words or characters, nor lines starting with ">". If detected, review and revise to ensure a pure Vietnamese translation containing only the main content.
Personal Pronouns: Do not retain Japanese pronouns (e.g., boku, watashi, atashi, uchi, wagahai, watakushi). Instead, use Vietnamese pronouns (e.g., tôi, mình, tao, ta, chị) as specified in the pronoun section.
Lines containing ">", e.g., "> Ema: |#0101Adv03_Ema004|", indicate dialogue spoken by that character. Keep track to ensure the dialogue reflects the correct speaker.

Preserving Structure and Tone:
Retain placeholders, variables, control codes, and line breaks (e.g., <br>).
Maintain the tone, voice, and Japanese honorifics (-kun, -san, -chan) for each character. Honorifics may be kept as is or adapted (e.g., translated as "cậu" [boy], "chị" [sister], or omitted depending on context, such as for older or superior characters).

Quality Notes:
Ensure the Vietnamese translation is smooth and natural, as if it were a published novel, preserving content but allowing adjustments for fluency. Absolutely do not omit details, but the text must flow naturally, avoiding overly literal translations.
The Vietnamese translation must convey full meaning, with sentences long enough to avoid awkwardness and without cutting or truncating the intended meaning.
Check the meaning of Kanji in the original text. If a Sino-Vietnamese word enhances the sentence, use it. For example, 悲 can be translated as "bi thương" (sorrow) depending on context.
Perform a thorough final review to eliminate errors and ensure translation quality, particularly ensuring no lines with ">" or XML tags, Chinese/Japanese characters, or words remain.
Character Names and Terminology: Translate strictly according to the provided list of names and terms, without altering or creating new ones.
